Events / Logic
What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)
keyboard event,

How do those events affect the data of the program?
the keyboard event will be used to move player1 and player2 up and down the screen to block incoming ball attacks

For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!

the following code below is an example of an event i will be using.


function handleKeyDown(event) {
    if (event.which ===KEY.W) {
      console.log("W")
      speedY = -5;
    }
    if (event.which ===KEY.S) {
      console.log("S")
      speedY = 5;
    }
   
}function handleKeyUp(event) {
  if (event.which ===KEY.W) {
    console.log("W")
    speedY = 0;
  }
  if (event.which ===KEY.S) {
    console.log("S")
    speedY = 0;
  }

  these functions uses the keyUp and keyDown event. i am using these keyboard events to make player1 and player2 move.
